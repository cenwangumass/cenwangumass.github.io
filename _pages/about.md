I am a PhD student in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst, advised by [Professor Peter Haas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phaas/). My research interests are in the areas of computer simulation, and more specifically using machine learning methods to create better simulation models. Before joining UMass, I received my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
